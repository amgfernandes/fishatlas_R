# A neuron-level atlas for the larval zebrafish brain

The goal of *fishatlas* is to provide R client utilities for interacting with the [Fish Brain Atlas Project](https://www.neuro.mpg.de/baier/connectome), which has [successfully](https://www.cell.com/neuron/pdfExtended/S0896-6273(19)30391-5) acquired and registered almost 2,000 neurons from the larval zebrafish into a standard, annotated template space. Using this R package in concert with the [natverse](https://github.com/natverse/natverse) ecosystem of neuroanatomy tools is highly recommended. The [project](https://www.neuro.mpg.de/baier/connectome) was conducted by the group of [Herwig Baier](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=e80hnfEAAAAJ&hl=en) at the [MPI](https://www.mpg.de/en),  primarily  by [Michael Kunst](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=yMyxCfQAAAAJ&hl=en). The website was created by [Nawwar Mokayes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nouwarmokayes/?originalSubdomain=de). The larval brain data has all been collected from fish at 6 days post-fertilisation.

## Installation

Firstly, you will need R, R Studio and X Quartz as well as nat and its dependencies. For detailed installation instructions for all this, see [here](https://jefferis.github.io/nat/articles/Installation.html). It should not take too long at all. Then:

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
# install
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("natverse/fishatlas")

# use 
library(fishatlas)
```

Done!

## Key Functions

Now we can have a look at what is available, here are some of the key functions. Their help details examples of their use. You can summon the help in RStudio using `?` followed by the function name.

```{r help, eval = FALSE}
# And how can I download and read neurons?
?fishatlas_read_saved_neurons()

# Get a 3D neuropil-subdivided brain model
?fishatlas_read_brain # Get 3D neuropil-subdivided brain models for those brainspaces
```

## Example

Let's also have a look at an example pulling neurons and brain meshes from [fishatlas.neuro.mpg.de](https://fishatlas.neuro.mpg.de). Excitingly, all the data is in a single standard template space!

![zbrain_neuropils](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/natverse/fishatlas/master/inst/images/zbrain_neuropils.png)

```{r insectbraindb.example, eval = FALSE}
## Lets have a look at these neuropils!
zfbrain = fishatlas_read_brain(type = "brain_regions")
plot3d(zfbrain)

## Maybe we just want to plot for forebrain
clear3d()
plot3d(subset(zfbrain, "Forebrain"), alpha = 0.5, col = "red")

## Maybe within the forebrain, we are interested in plotting the habenula
plot3d(subset(zfbrain, "Habenula"), alpha = 0.3, col = "red")

## First we need to download all of the neurons
### We should only ever have to do this once!
fishatlas_download_neurons()

## Let's get all that sweet neuron data!
zfishn = fishatlas_read_saved_neurons(side = "Original")
plot3d(zfishn,soma = TRUE, lwd = 2)

## Hmm, but it would be better to have them all on the same side
clear3d()
zfishr = fishatlas_read_saved_neurons(side = "Right")
plot3d(zfishr,soma = TRUE, lwd = 2, col = "red")

## Great! How does that compare with neurons all on the left?
### Let's just look at the first 10 mirored.
zfishl = fishatlas_mirror_saved_neurons(fishatlas_neurons[1:10], side = "Left")
plot3d(zfishl,soma = TRUE, lwd = 2, col = "cyan")
```
